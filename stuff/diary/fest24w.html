		<p>I haven't really thought of this before now, so I'll just provide a quick recap of what's happened for the past few days! A while ago, I decided I wanted to join, but couldn't find any songs I wanted to chart, so I looked to the Danoni server for help. Thank you apo-san for helping with song choice this whole time! :pray: In the end, I decided on Halv - Chaotic Heart.</p>

		<p>That same day, I also decided on the songs for my collabs with apo-san and hsvsj! Excited, I immediately took to charting Chaotic Heart. The very first version was sent to apoi for review, and here is what he said:</p>
		<p>Taking his advice, I looked for examples in his charting and others', looking for examples of how this was done!
